## Overview
-----------------------
This project is a mobile application designed to help students plan, track, and manage their academic tasks and deadlines effectively.

-----------------------
## Motivation
-----------------------
As a high school student, I noticed that many students struggle with organizing subjects, assignments, and exam preparation. I decided to build this app to create a simple and structured way for students to manage their studies and reduce academic stress.
